# Contributing to MyApp

Thank you for your interest in contributing to MyApp! This document provides a guideline for contributing to our Laravel application using GitHub, ensuring a smooth workflow for everyone involved.

## Workflow Overview

Our workflow is designed to ensure that the codebase remains clean, well-documented, and easy to understand. We use GitHub Issues for task management and a Kanban board for tracking progress.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the repository to your GitHub account. This will be your private workspace.

2. **Clone the Forked Repository**: Clone the repository to your local machine to start working on the changes.

3. **Set Up the Development Environment**: Follow the setup instructions in the README.md to set up your local development environment.

## Making Changes

1. **Create a New Issue**: Before starting work on a new feature or a bug fix, make sure there is an issue created for it. If not, create a new issue describing the feature or bug.

2. **Start with a Fresh Branch**: For each new feature or bug fix, create a new branch from the latest version of the main branch. Use a descriptive name for your branch, such as `feature/add-login-button` or `fix/header-alignment`.

3. **Commit Your Changes**: Make your changes locally and commit them to your branch. Use clear and concise commit messages, following the conventional commit format.

4. **Keep Your Branch Updated**: Regularly rebase your branch from the main branch to keep it up to date with the latest changes.

## Submitting Changes

1. **Run Tests and Linters**: Before submitting your changes, make sure to run tests and linters to ensure that your code adheres to the project standards.

2. **Open a Pull Request (PR)**: Once your changes are ready and tested, push your branch to your fork and open a pull request against the original repository's main branch. Provide a clear description of the changes and link the related issue(s).

3. **Review Process**: The team will review your PR. Be open to feedback and make necessary adjustments. Your PR might go through several rounds of review before merging.

4. **Merge**: Once your PR is approved, a maintainer will merge it into the main branch.

## After Your Changes Are Merged

1. **Update Your Local Main Branch**: After your changes have been merged, make sure to pull the latest changes from the main branch of the original repository to your local main branch.

2. **Delete Your Feature Branch**: If your branch was merged or closed, you can safely delete your branch.

## Using the Kanban Board

- **Pick Up Tasks**: Check the Kanban board for available tasks. Move the issue you are working on to the "In Progress" column.

- **Update Task Status**: Regularly update the issue status to reflect the current state, moving it through "In Review" when you have a PR open, and finally to "Done" when the task is completed.

## Best Practices

- **Communicate**: Use GitHub comments to communicate progress, ask questions, and clarify requirements.
- **Small PRs**: Aim to keep your pull requests small and focused on a single feature or bug fix to simplify the review process.
- **Documentation**: Update the documentation to reflect any changes in the setup process or feature usage.
